# AUTOSARLang: Threat Modeling and Attack Simulation for Vehicle Cybersecurity

AUTOSARLang - a vehicular (AUTOSAR running) cybersecurity threat model and attack simulator language. It is designed based on Meta Attack Language /MAL/.

AUTOSARLang, the threat model, is written with MAL /Meta Attack Language/ specification. It has five categories namely system, communication, security, network, and people. In each category, assets with their corresponding attacks and attack steps are defined. The attack simulation language is written in Java. 

The implementation (MAL specification) of the AUTOSARLang is written in seven separate files. Each file can be taken as a module (part of the whole).
